# BukkitNoLogStripping
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/nologstripping

This plugin can protect users from accidental log stripping.
I click on logs beside doors quite often. If I happen to hold an axe, that usually means to get a new log and replace the wrongly stripped one.
Players can toggle the log stripping on and off with /nologstripping or /nlg. This just stays as it is for the current session. They can also toggle their default with/nologstrippingdefault.
Works with all wood, logs, stems and hyphae.

commands:
/nologstripping /nlg

/nologstrippingdefault

 

permissions: (to change settings)
